This repository is home of the framework TMEA ( **T**hermodynamically **M**otivated **E**nrichment **A**nalysis ), which we created from the scripts we used in our 2020 [Entropy paper]( https://doi.org/10.3390/e22091030)

## Introduction 

The objective of gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) in modern biological studies is to identify functional 
profiles in huge sets of biomolecules generated by high throughput measurements of genes, transcripts, metabolites, 
and proteins. GSEA is based on a two-stage process using classical statistical analysis to score the input data and 
subsequent testing for overrepresentation of the enrichment score within a given functional coherent set. 
However, enrichment scores computed by different methods are merely statistically motivated and often elusive to 
direct biological interpretation. 

Here, we propose a novel approach, called Thermodynamically Motivated Enrichment Analysis (TMEA), to account for the 
energy investment in biological relevant processes. Therefore, TMEA is based on surprisal analysis, that offers a 
thermodynamic-free energy-based representation of the biological steady state and of the biological change. 
The contribution of each biomolecule underlying the changes in free energy is used in a Monte Carlo resampling 
procedure resulting in a functional characterization directly coupled to the thermodynamic characterization of 
biological responses to system perturbations.
