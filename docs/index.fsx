This repository is home of the framework TMEA ( **T**hermodynamically **M**otivated **E**nrichment **A**nalysis ), which we created from the scripts we used in our 2020 [Entropy paper]( https://doi.org/10.3390/e22091030)

Find the authors on github: [Kevin Schneider](https://github.com/kMutagene) (1), [Benedikt Venn](https://github.com/bvenn) (1), [Timo Mühlhaus](https://github.com/muehlhaus)
